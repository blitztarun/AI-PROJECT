# PROJECTS
                            **# Survival Analysis & Classification of Lung Cancer**

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing survival rates and classifying lung cancer cases based on medical and demographic factors. Using statistical analysis, machine learning classification, and visualization techniques, the study aims to predict survival chances and provide insights into patient outcomes.

## Key Components
### 1. Introduction to Lung Cancer
- **Definition:** Lung cancer originates in lung tissues, particularly in cells lining the air passages.
- **Types:**
  - **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)** – the most common type.
  - **Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)** – aggressive and spreads quickly.
- **Causes:** Smoking, air pollution, genetics, secondhand smoke, and environmental exposure.
- **Symptoms:** Persistent cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, and weight loss.
- **Diagnosis:** Imaging techniques like **X-rays, CT scans, and biopsies**.
- **Treatments:** Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy.
- **Prevention:** Avoiding smoking and reducing exposure to carcinogens.

### 2. Data Analysis & Preprocessing
- The dataset consists of patient records, including **age, smoking history, tumor stage, treatment methods, and survival outcomes**.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Selecting relevant features to enhance predictive accuracy.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizing lung cancer trends using **Seaborn and Matplotlib**.
- Identifying correlations between patient demographics and survival rates.
- Analyzing the impact of treatment types on prognosis.

### 4. Machine Learning Classification
- Implementing **classification models** to predict lung cancer survival chances.
- **Algorithms used:**
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest Classifier  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Neural Networks (if applicable)  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 5. Survival Analysis
- Applying **Kaplan-Meier Estimator** to visualize survival probabilities over time.
- Performing **Cox Proportional-Hazards Model** to identify key survival factors.
- Comparing survival rates between different cancer stages and treatment plans.

### 6. Results & Findings
- Insights on which **factors significantly impact survival** (e.g., age, tumor stage, treatment type).
- Classification model performance and **best predictive model** for survival.
- Recommendations for **early diagnosis and improved treatment strategies**.

## Technologies & Tools Used
- **Python Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Statistical Models:** Kaplan-Meier, Cox Regression
- **Jupyter Notebook** for implementation and visualization
